description: The $\Delta t_{\text{DT}}$ distribution for 2016 data, MC simulated cosmic ray muon, 1000 GeV gluino signal, and 600 GeV MCHAMP signal events, for the muon search. The events plotted pass a subset of the full analysis selection that is designed to select good-quality DSA muon tracks but does not reject the cosmic ray muon background. The number of cosmic ray muon background events is greatly reduced when the full selection is applied, as we require $\Delta t_{\text{DT}}>-20$ ns and $\Delta t_{\text{RPC}}>-7.5$ ns. The histograms are normalized to unit area.

description: The background extrapolation for the muon search. The integral of the fit function to $\Delta t_{DT}$ with the sum of two Gaussian distributions and a Crystal Ball function, for $\Delta t_{DT}$>âˆ’20 ns, is plotted as a function of the lower $\Delta t_{RPC}$ selection, for 2015 and 2016 data. The uncertainties correspond to when the fit function parameters are varied by one standard deviation.

description: The 95% CL upper limits on $\mathcal{B}\sigma$ for gluino pair production, using the cloud model of R-hadron interactions, as a function of lifetime, for combined 2015 and 2016 data for the calorimeter search. We show gluinos that undergo a two-body decay. The discontinuous structure observed between $10^{-7}$ and $10^{-5}$ s is due to the increase of the number of observed events in the search window as the lifetime increases.
