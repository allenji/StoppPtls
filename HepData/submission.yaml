description: The background extrapolation for the muon search. The integral of the fit function to $\Delta t_{\text{DT}}$ with the sum of two Gaussian distributions and a Crystal Ball function, for $\Delta t_{\text{DT}}>-20$ ns, is plotted as a function of the lower $\Delta t_{\text{RPC}}$ selection, for 2015 and 2016 data. The points are fitted with an error function and used to extrapolate to the signal region, which is defined as $\Delta t_{\text{RPC}}>-7.5$ ns.

description: The 95% CL upper limits on $\mathcal{B}\sigma$ for gluino pair production, using the cloud model of R-hadron interactions, as a function of lifetime, for combined 2015 and 2016 data for the calorimeter search. We show gluinos that undergo a two-body decay. The discontinuous structure observed between $10^{-7}$ and $10^{-5}$ s is due to the increase of the number of observed events in the search window as the lifetime increases.

description: The 95% CL upper limits on $\mathcal{B}\sigma$ for top squark pair production, using the cloud model of R-hadron interactions, as a function of lifetime, for combined 2015 and 2016 data for the calorimeter search. We show top squarks that undergo a two-body decay. The discontinuous structure observed between $10^{-7}$ and $10^{-5}$ s is due to the increase of the number of observed events in the search window as the lifetime increases.

description: The 95% CL upper limits on $\mathcal{B}\sigma$ for gluino pair production, using the cloud model of R-hadron interactions, as a function of lifetime, for combined 2015 and 2016 data for the calorimeter search. We show gluinos that undergo a three-body decay. The discontinuous structure observed between $10^{-7}$ and $10^{-5}$ s is due to the increase of the number of observed events in the search window as the lifetime increases.
